Come clean
Lay one's card on the table 0835
Cover up 0575
Skeleton in one's closet
Under the table 0675
Burn the candle at both ends 0595
Drag one's feet 0703
Go all out 1085
Half-hearted 0595
Music to my ears 0614
Get off one's chest 0304
Burst one's bubble 0534
The chips are down 0021
See eye to eye 0055
Cut a deal 0021
As a last resort 0304
No magic bullet 0675
At a snail's pace 0021
Fall into place 0534 0021
Take off 0712
Carry the ball 0304
Call it a day
Cut corners 0976
Hard pill to swallow
Back to square one 0304
