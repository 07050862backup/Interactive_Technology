Come clean
Lay one's card on the table 
Cover up 
Skeleton in one's closet
Under the table 
Burn the candle at both ends 
Drag one's feet 
Go all out 
Half-hearted 
Music to my ears 
Get off one's chest 
Burst one's bubble 
The chips are down 
See eye to eye 
Cut a deal 
As a last resort 
No magic bullet 
At a snail's pace 
Fall into place  
Take off 
Carry the ball 
Call it a day
Cut corners 
Hard pill to swallow
Back to square one
